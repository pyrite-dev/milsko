# Writing a new widget
@warning This is mainly for developers

1. Create new file in src/widget with lower case
2. Create new header in include/Mw/Widget with pascal case
3. Add the header include to include/Mw/Milsko.h, if new widget does not require some extension (like OpenGL and Vulkan)
4. See another widget for example
